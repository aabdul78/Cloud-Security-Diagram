# Cloud-Security-Diagram

I created a network diagram to illustrate my entire cloud infrastructure, which includes an Ansible jump box and Docker containers running on each virtual machine (VM). This document can be added to my portfolio to showcase my technical skills.

For this, I used a free account on draw.io to diagram the entire cloud network setup that Iâ€™ve implemented.

The diagram includes the following details:


Azure resource group

Virtual network with its IP address range and subnet range

Traffic flow (e.g., HTTP, SSH)

Security group configurations blocking specific traffic

Load balancer setup

All 4 VMs I have deployed

Docker and Ansible deployment locations

This visual representation highlights my ability to design and manage a cloud network with the necessary components and configurations.
